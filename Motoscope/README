Haya

I will be building a MotoGP website. 

On there you will be seeing current and past MotoGP riders, teams, circuits and GPs.

This information will be displayed using jQuery and APIs. 

There will also be functions with which you can place bets on which rider will finish at what position.
(You can win no money here!)
